# Exploring_Weather_Trends
This project was done in partial fulfilment of the Data Analysis nanodegree on Udacity (2021). Below are the summarized project instructions, as stated o: 

Exploring Weather Trends - Project Instructions
Summary
In this project, you will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends where you live to overall global temperature trends.

Instructions
Your goal will be to create a visualization and prepare a write up describing the similarities and differences between global temperature trends and temperature trends in the closest big city to where you live.

* Extract the data from the database.
* Create a line chart that compares your city’s temperatures with the global temperatures. Make sure to plot the moving average rather than the yearly averages in order to smooth out the lines, making trends more observable (the last concept in the previous lesson goes over how to do this in a spreadsheet).
* Make observations about the similarities and differences between the world averages and your city’s averages, as well as overall trends.

Source of Data: Made available by Udacity.
